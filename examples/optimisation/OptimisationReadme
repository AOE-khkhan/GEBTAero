This folder contain a simple test case of openMDAO optimisation
It consists in a two-ply laminate with various lower and upper ply orientation.
The Classes folder contains the openMDAO Explicit Component used to :
- compute the flexibility matrix coefficient (SouplesseMat)
- compute the aeroelastic critical speed of the laminate (Vflutter)

4 scripts are added to illustrate the optimisation of the flexibility matrix coefficients and the critical speed using COBYLA and SimpleGA (genetic) optimisation algorithms.
